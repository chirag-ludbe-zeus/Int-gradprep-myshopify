Due to this scoring method, it's possible to miss a few questions on the LSAT and still earn a perfect score.<\/p>"}},"298049ec-ca37-478e-a3dd-3d25fd840bb4":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"<p class=\"question\">How many times can you take the LSAT?<\/p>","answer":"<p class=\"answer\">You can take the LSAT exam 3 times within a single testing year (between June 1st and May 31st).
